<h1 align="left">A Survey on Post Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms</h1>

###

<h2 align="left">Overview:- </h2>

###
This survey centres around the Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithm, a critical subject considering the vulnerability of current public key infrastructure, notably RSA and Diffie-Hellman, to quantum computers. The imperative to secure the Internet's security architecture from potential quantum threats necessitates a quantum-resistant approach. Addressing these security concerns falls within the realm of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) taking a lead role in standardization. The 3rd round of NIST has identified three finalists (CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and Rainbow) and three alternate candidates (GeMSS, Picnic, and SPHINCS+) for PQC digital signatures. This survey assesses these candidates, considering factors such as security, performance, efficiency, and their applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.

* Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents.
* The process entails the sender signing a message using their private key and sending it. Later, the receiver verifies the message using the sender's public key and determines whether to accept it or not.
